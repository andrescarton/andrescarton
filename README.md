## üöÄ **About me** 

I am a cheerful and curious Data Scientist who truly believes in the power of artificial intelligence, machine learning and automation.

Currently fulfilling my dream of studying and living abroad and am now open to new opportunities to develop my career in Ireland further.

Throughout my career, I have worked mainly with CRM systems automation in the Banking industry, analysing the client database, behaviour, journey, transactions, budgets, and expenses to bring the best solutions through automation and machine learning developments. I successfully improved customer experience and sales results by performing deep-dive analysis with a view to delivering opportunities for operational efficiencies, created a 360-degree view of operational performance, and identified and prioritised key business questions to provide data-driven solutions to support critical decision-making and increase revenue results.

Where can you find me?
